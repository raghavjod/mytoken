# MyToken Smart Contract
This Solidity smart contract, named MyToken, provides a basic implementation of a token. It allows you to mint (create) and burn (destroy) tokens. Below are the instructions for running this code in Remix:

Remix Setup
Install Remix: If you don't already have Remix installed, you can access it online at Remix Ethereum. No local installation is required.

Select Solidity Compiler Version: In Remix, make sure to select the Solidity compiler version compatible with the contract. This contract is written in Solidity 0.8.18.

Running the MyToken Contract
Create a New File:

In Remix, create a new file with a .sol extension.
Copy and paste the code from the provided contract into this file.
Compile the Contract:

In Remix, go to the "Solidity Compiler" tab on the left sidebar.
Select the version "0.8.18" from the dropdown to match the contract's Solidity version.
Click the "Compile MyToken.sol" button to compile the contract.
Deploy the Contract:

Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab on the left sidebar.
Make sure the "Environment" is set to "Injected Web3" to connect to your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
Click the "Deploy" button to deploy the contract to the Ethereum network.
Using the MyToken Contract
You can interact with the deployed contract using Remix's user interface. The contract provides two main functions, mint and burn, as described in the code comments.

Mint Tokens:

Call the mint function by providing an Ethereum address and a value to mint new tokens.
Burn Tokens:

Call the burn function by providing an Ethereum address and a value to burn (destroy) tokens. This function has a conditional check to ensure that the sender has enough tokens to burn.
